A simple to use widget/sqlite database that will allow for the quick generation
and updating of existing character sheats. 

STATUS:
The newest verison of the project is in its infancy.  Just started to put together
a small test database of feats, skills, and items. As well as began work on
building a GUI using the go-gtk bindings. 


Other Versions:

If you do not fear the sagetex, feel free to grab the src file from the already completed druid
character sheet.

-Started work on the UI widget, as well as creating a test sqlite database to hold feats, skills
and items.

-Decided to change tactics, rather than build what was turning into a huge and
complex .tex file.  The goal of the project will be to create a easy to use 
.tex file generator with all the avaible calculations already completed.

-Started to separate into different funtional files rather than one
long .tex file
