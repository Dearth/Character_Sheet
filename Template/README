The character sheet template uses python scripts inside of a latex document 
to output a Pathfinder Character Sheet.  

STATUS:

The project is currently in pieces, I am in the middle of transitioning it from
sagetex, which not everyone has and is a pain to get running, to just python.  
Hopefully this move will allow for more usablity.  

If you do not fear the sagetex, feel free to grab the src file from the already completed druid
character sheet.

-Started to separate into different funtional files rather than one
long .tex file

7/27/12
-Decided to change tactics, rather than build what was turning into a huge and
complex .tex file.  The goal of the project will be to create a easy to use 
.tex file generator with all the avaible calculations already completed.
